## Programming Language Suggester

#### By Brian Scherner

#### A simple application for suggesting programming languages.

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap
* JavaScript

## Description

This application allows users who are new to coding to answer five "yes" or "no" questions to determine which programming language they should learn first. Depending on the combination of answers, three language suggestions will be displayed (Ruby, C#, and JavaScript). Users may also be suggested to learn other languages (Python, Go, and Rust), if the combination of their answers isn't best suited to Ruby, C#, or JavaScript. If users want to answer the questions again, they can reset their answers after submitting the form. Application can be accessed here: https://bscherner.github.io/language-suggester/

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Clone this repository to your desktop.
* Navigate to the index.html file in the directory.
* Open index.html in your browser.

## Known Bugs

Every single possible combination of answers is not accounted for. I plan to make the branching logic more specific later on. I also want to add more questions.
